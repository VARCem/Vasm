Welcome to **VARCem**, the Virtual Archaeological Computer EMulator.

Vasm is a multi-target, table-driven cross assembler, part of the
VARCem8 emulator project. It implements a general assembler block
with the usual (and, some less usual) features, and then uses a
back-end specific for a given microprocessor to generate code for
that processor.

HISTORY
-------
Vasm has its roots in the [asm6502](https://github.com/boeckmann/asm6502) project.


LICENSE
-------
Vasm is released under the MIT license, the same license as the
original project (see HISTORY above.)

Author credits and specific copyrights can be found in each of
the source files.

Obviously, where license terms of individual modules deviate from
the general project license terms, the terms of such an individual
module prevail.


Community and Support
---------------------
Information, downloads, additional modules and such can be found on our
[Website](http://www.VARCem.com/). Live support and general help can
also be found on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/TeubH2bxzT). We

It's free, it comes with all the sources, but it does not come with
any warranty whatsoever. You probably should not use this software to run
a business-critical piece of (old) software at work, for example.

If there is a problem with the software, please open up a GIT issue so we
can work on it, and/or talk to us on the IRC channel. We cannot promise a
fix, but will try the best we can !

Welcome to **VARCem**, the Virtual Archaeological Computer EMulator.

**Vasm** is a multi-target, table-driven cross assembler, part of the
VARCem8 emulator project. It implements a general assembler block
with the usual (and, some less usual) features, and then uses a
back-end specific for a given microprocessor to generate code for
that processor.

HISTORY
-------
Vasm has its roots in the [asm6502](https://github.com/boeckmann/asm6502)
project.  From there on, the code was split up into modules, features
have been added and existing features have been improved. All this
did not fit within the design goals of the original project, resulting
in a fork so both projects can benefit.

LICENSE
-------
VARCem as a whole is released under the BSD 3-Clause Open Software
License, which is compatible with the GPL (GNU Public License)
version 2 or later that is used by many of the modules imported
from other emulator projects. Parts project are released under the
MIT license.

The author of the original project (see HISTORY above) has authorized
the VARCem team to re-license its fork of their project to the
BSD 3-Clause Open Source License.

Author credits and specific copyrights can be found in each of
the source files.

Obviously, where license terms of individual modules deviate from
the general project license terms, the terms of such an individual
module prevail.

It's free, it comes with all the sources, but it does not come with
any warranty whatsoever. You probably should not use this software to run
a business-critical piece of (old) software at work, for example.

If there is a problem with the software, please open up a GIT issue so we
can work on it, and/or talk to us on the IRC channel. We cannot promise a
fix, but will try the best we can !

- macro variable arguments

- first page title gets lost (we need to buffer lines for each page, and
  not flush out until page is done)

- maybe we should let .subttl flush the current page?

- ifndef..endif should only check definition in pass1, because in pass2
  it may be defined by its own block..

- allow the backends to set frontend variables, such as with of address
  field, number of code bytes per line, default radix, which char to use
  for dot labels, and so on.
  --> addr width, codebytes done

- REPEAT still messes up line numbers
